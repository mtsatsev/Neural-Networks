    "Autonomous agents often learn from *rewards* (= positive or negative feedback quantities, i.e. this term includes rewards and punishments). In this set-up, the environment is considered a blackbox that returns a *reward* after an agent performs an *action*. In a typical setup rewards are the only thing agents know about their environment. This is the subject matter of reinforcement learning. \n",

    "In this assignment you will learn to implement an agent which can learn from its mistakes using reinforcement learning. \n",

    "We provide the environment `EvidenceEnv` that has a hidden world state (`0` or `1`). The task of the agent is to guess the right hidden world state, and the agent will receive a reward of `+1` or `-1` based on whether the guess was right or wrong respectively. The agent gets *evidence* from `EvidenceEnv` for being able to make an informed guess. The generated evidence is *equal* to the true state with probability $p$, and different from the true state with probability $1-p$. \n",
